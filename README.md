# StudentManager
Student Management System with GUI and Database using Java for SHS in San Nicholas III in Bacoor City Students and Administrators in mind.

## Dependencies
- Java 15
- MySql or SqlLite
- Eclipse (Eclipse Mars IDE)
- XAMPP (For managing the database)
- LGoodDatePicker-11.2.1
- jdatechooser by Androsov Vadim

## Why use a Management System?
This will give the both end a visual representation of how thier data passed in school and what goes to their name in terms of guidance records, courses, attendance, health records, and so on. It will help all of the school teachers to have a main software and database to look at and also the students when it comes to accessing their names. This will also handle the date carefully with multiple hashes and a salt in mind, to encrypt the database.


## Java Integration
This uses JFrame as the main window, that's the new changes so far.
Added a lot of Frames and panels for different styles, layout and functionalities.

## Status
Main functionalities is stagnant as of now due to the messy code.

Still on cleaning and establishing a connection to the database.

Re-writing a lot of parts of the system due to messy code.

Will try to fix things and connect the system to its database properly.

Updates will be stagnant due to the start of college and can't handle things for now.
