## Why use a Management System?
This will give the both end a visual representation of how thier data passed in school and what goes to their name in terms of guidance records, courses, attendance, health records, and so on. It will help all of the school teachers to have a main software and database to look at and also the students when it comes to accessing their names. This will also handle the date carefully with multiple hashes and a salt in mind, to encrypt the database.

Functionality will be the focus first since it is more neeeded.
